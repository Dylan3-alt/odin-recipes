        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pasta Alla Gricia completes the four classic pasta dishes of Rome. It's a classic for good reason: with only four ingredients, it's simple to make, easy to indulge.</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 oz.guanciale, diced into ¼” pieces s</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp.freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 c.water</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. Kosher salt</li>
            <li> 8 oz.tagliatelle</li>
            <li> 3 oz.freshly grated Pecorino (about 1 ½ cup), divided, plus more for serving</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large high-sided pan over medium-high heat, cook pancetta, stirring frequently, until deeply golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and, keeping the fat in the pan, use a slotted spoon to transfer guanciale to a plate. Add pepper to pan and stir to toast.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add water and salt to a medium-large pot and bring to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring to prevent sticking, until pliable, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Return pan to medium-low heat. Add 1 ¾ cup pasta water to pan and swirl to combine. Add parcooked pasta and ½ cup of Pecorino and stir to coat evenly. Once Pecorino is mostly melted, gradually stir in remaining Pecorino in 2 to 3 batches, adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce silky. Once pasta is al dente, remove from heat and continue stirring gently until sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold in cooked guanciale and serve with more Pecorino, if desired. </li>
